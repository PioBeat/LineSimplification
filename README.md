# Line Simplification and Time Series Approximation

This repository contains R scripts and functions used to evaluate line simplification algorithms for feature selection, as discussed in the accompanying Medium article:

ðŸ‘‰ ["A Small Study of Line Simplification Algorithms for Feature Selection"](https://medium.com/@Dominik_Grzelak/a-small-study-of-line-simplification-algorithms-for-feature-selection-5916467dc4ba)

This small study explores how various line simplification techniques can be applied to time series data to reduce dimensionality and extract meaningful features.
